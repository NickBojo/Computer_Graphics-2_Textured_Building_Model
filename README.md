# EECE 478 Computer Graphics: Textured Building Model

### Part 2 of 3

This project uses OpenGL and GLUT to model and render various things, from single models to entire scenes.

Part 2 builds on the simple model importer and viewer from Part 1.

The first step was to model a building from the UBC campus. The EarthOceanSciences buiding model was made from scratch in a class proprietary format from photographs, floorplans, and built with vertices and face-culled triangles. The model is textured and lit, and a screenshot is provided.

The second step was to modify the original viewer to support the import, modeling, and texturing of a new model file, and to prepare for future steps involving multiple models and full scenes.
